# Troubleshooting

A guide to checking what agterm is doing, the most common problems, and how to report one that turns out to be a bug.

## Where things live

Paths assume the defaults. When `AGTERM_STATE_DIR` is set, the state files and test configuration move under that directory instead of the platform application-support directory.

- **Keymap**: `~/.config/agterm/keymap.conf` (or `$AGTERM_STATE_DIR/config/keymap.conf`, or a custom directory set in Settings ▸ Key Mapping).
- **Ghostty config**: `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf` (same directory as the keymap), an agterm-scoped ghostty config that overrides the bundled defaults and your global `~/.config/ghostty/config`.
- **Settings**: `<state>/settings.json`.
- **Window and session state**: `<state>/windows.json` plus one `windows/<id>.json` per window.
- **Control socket**: `<state>/agterm.sock` (or `$AGTERM_CONTROL_SOCKET` when set). A spawned shell sees the bound path in `$AGTERM_SOCKET`.
- **macOS state**: `~/Library/Application Support/agterm`.
- **Linux state**: the Foundation application-support directory for the current user; run `printf '%s\n' "$AGTERM_SOCKET"` inside agterm to see the active directory, or set `AGTERM_STATE_DIR` for an isolated instance.
- **Logs**: macOS uses unified logging under `com.umputun.agterm`; the Linux development build writes diagnostics to its process journal or stderr.

## Reading the logs

agterm logs to the unified logging system, so use `log` or Console:

```bash
# the last 30 minutes, all categories
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"' --info --last 30m

# follow live while you reproduce the problem
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"' --info

# narrow to one area
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm" && category == "CustomCommandRunner"' --info --last 30m
```

The categories are `CustomCommandRunner`, `SettingsModel`, `GhosttyApp`, `NotificationManager`, and `ControlServer`. In Console.app, filter on the same subsystem.

On Linux, launch the development binary from a terminal to retain stderr, or inspect the desktop-session journal:

```bash
journalctl --user --since "30 minutes ago" | grep -i agterm
```

## Checking Linux integrations

The Integrations page and the local CLI use the same inspection engine.
The CLI does not connect to the control socket, so it also works while agterm is stopped:

```bash
agtermctl integration status
agtermctl integration status --json
agtermctl integration install hooks --dry-run
agtermctl integration install skill --dry-run
```

A `conflict` status means agterm found unrelated content and deliberately refused to replace it.
For a multi-target hooks or skill install, independently safe targets can still be applied while the protected target is skipped and reported.
Read the reported path and detail, move or merge that content yourself, then refresh the Integrations page.
Exit status `2` is a protected conflict, `4` is a filesystem write failure, `1` is an unavailable bundled resource, and `64` is a malformed command line.

Native DEB/RPM installations keep `/usr/bin/agtermctl` under package-manager ownership.
Tar and development builds can create an agterm-owned launcher in `~/.local/bin` from Preferences ▸ Integrations.
AppImage and Flatpak builds do not offer a host launcher because their executable paths are temporary or sandbox-local; use a native package, an extracted AppImage, or the tar archive for a persistent CLI.

Hook installation preserves existing settings and writes a backup before changing Claude or Codex configuration.
Malformed settings and pre-existing custom hook definitions are reported as conflicts for manual resolution.
The skill installer updates only an agterm-managed `~/.claude/skills/agterm` or `~/.codex/skills/agterm` directory and refuses an unrelated directory with the same name.

Pi integration is available only after Pi has created `~/.pi/agent`.
After installing or updating hooks, restart Pi or run `/reload` so it loads
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/agterm-status.ts`.
An unmarked file at that path is user-owned and is reported as a conflict rather than replaced.

## Checking packaged Ghostty resources on Linux

Release artifacts contain the pinned Ghostty themes, shell integration, and an `xterm-ghostty` terminfo entry.
Run `scripts/verify-linux-resources.sh <payload>/share` from a checkout to validate an extracted tar, DEB, or RPM
payload; `scripts/verify-linux-packages.sh VERSION DIRECTORY` checks all four release formats.
The app uses `TERM=xterm-ghostty` only when it resolves both the shell-integration tree and sibling terminfo entry.
If either is missing, it uses the portable `TERM=xterm-256color` fallback instead of advertising an unavailable
terminal definition.

## Dashboard or notification navigation looks wrong on Linux

The dashboard opens from **Ctrl+Shift+M**, the command palette, or the grid button beside Quick Terminal.
A single click briefly highlights a cell before entering its exact pane; keyboard Enter enters immediately.
Dashboard and terminal-zoom headers show `Dashboard` or the active session title plus a custom window name.

A desktop notification is suppressed only when its exact terminal surface is focused in the active window.
Clicking a delivered notification selects its encoded pane and reopens its source window if that window was closed.
An explicit `agtermctl notify` request deliberately bypasses focus suppression.

## Checking the keymap

After editing `keymap.conf`, nothing changes until you reload it.

- **Settings ▸ Key Mapping** shows a read-only list of parse problems (a malformed line, a dropped binding, a conflict). This is the first place to look when a binding does not behave.
- **File ▸ Reload Keymap** re-reads the file. A reload that found problems posts a banner with the count.
- **`agtermctl keymap reload`** does the same from the command line and prints the diagnostic count (`0` means a clean reload).

## The keymap editor will not open

**Edit Keymap** (File ▸ Edit Keymap…, or the `⌃⇧P` palette) opens `keymap.conf` in `$VISUAL`, else `$EDITOR`, else `vi`, inside a floating overlay over the active session. The overlay runs the editor through your login shell, so the editor resolves the same way it does in a normal terminal — whether your login shell is zsh/bash or fish.

Common causes when nothing usable appears:

1. **A GUI editor without its blocking flag.** Editors like VS Code, Sublime, Zed, and TextMate launch a detached window and return immediately, so the overlay opens and closes in a flash. Set the editor's wait flag so the launcher blocks until you close the file:

   ```bash
   export EDITOR='code -w'     # VS Code; also: 'subl -w', 'zed -w', 'mate -w', 'cursor -w'
   ```

2. **`$EDITOR` unset.** You get `vi` inside the overlay. Press `i` to start typing, then `Esc` and `:wq` to save and quit; the keymap reloads when the editor exits.
3. **No active session, or an overlay is already open.** Edit Keymap is a no-op with no session selected, or while another overlay or the quick terminal is up. Select a session and close any overlay first.

Set and **export** `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL` in your shell startup file (`export EDITOR=…` in `~/.zshrc`/`~/.bashrc`, or `set -gx EDITOR …` in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`), not just in the current shell. The overlay reads the *exported* value from your login shell, so a value that lives in one terminal session only — or one set without `export` — is not seen and falls back to `vi`.

## A custom action does nothing

Work down this list:

1. **Read the diagnostics.** Open Settings ▸ Key Mapping. A malformed `command` line is listed there and skipped.
2. **Chord conflict.** If your chord collides with a built-in shortcut or with another custom command, the binding is dropped and the command becomes palette-only. It still runs from the action palette (`⌃⇧P`), where it is listed with a `custom` tag. Pick a free chord, or run it from the palette.
3. **Reserved chords.** `ctrl+tab` / `ctrl+shift+tab` (the session switcher), `ctrl+1` / `ctrl+2` (pane focus), and Linux `ctrl+,` (Preferences) are reserved and cannot be bound.
4. **Modifier-less keys are rejected.** A custom chord needs at least one modifier so it cannot shadow a plain terminal key. `command "x" g …` is palette-only; `command "x" cmd+g …` binds.
5. **Focus.** A custom chord fires only while a terminal pane holds keyboard focus. When the sidebar, the inline rename field, a Settings field, or a palette has focus, the chord passes through. Click into the terminal first.
6. **The command runs in a plain `/bin/sh -c`, not your login shell.** It does not load `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, so shell aliases and functions are not available and `PATH` may be shorter than in your terminal. Use absolute paths, or wrap the body in `$SHELL -lc '…'`.
7. **Exit status.** A non-zero exit posts a failure banner with the code. No banner and no effect usually means the chord never fired (causes above). A banner means it ran and failed, which points at the command itself, its `PATH`, or its arguments.
8. **Token quoting.** `{AGT_SELECTION}` and the other `{AGT_*}` tokens expand raw into the shell line. For content that may contain shell metacharacters, use the `$AGT_SELECTION` environment form, which is already quoted. The token list is in the keymap section of the README.

Reload after every edit (File ▸ Reload Keymap, or `agtermctl keymap reload`). Edits are not applied until you do.

## Changing ghostty settings

Most terminal behavior comes from ghostty. The common knobs (font, theme, background opacity and blur, scroll speed) are in agterm's Settings, but any other ghostty key (`macos-option-as-alt`, `keybind`, `window-padding-*`, and so on) is set in a config file.

agterm reads four config sources, each overriding the one before it:

```
ghostty's bundled defaults  →  ~/.config/ghostty/config  →  <config dir>/ghostty.conf  →  agterm Settings
       (lowest)                    (your global config)         (agterm-scoped)             (UI wins)
```

- `<config dir>/ghostty.conf` (default `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf`, next to `keymap.conf`) is scoped to agterm only; the standalone Ghostty.app never reads it. Use it for keys you want in agterm but not everywhere.
- `~/.config/ghostty/config` is your global ghostty config, shared with Ghostty.app, and already in the chain.
- The keys agterm sets from its Settings window load last, so the Settings picker wins for what it manages. Put everything else in `ghostty.conf`.

Edit `ghostty.conf` with **File ▸ Edit ghostty.conf…** (or the ⌃⇧P palette), which opens it in `$EDITOR` and reloads on exit, the same as Edit Keymap. After editing it elsewhere, apply it with **File ▸ Reload Config**, the action palette, or `agtermctl config reload`. A malformed line is skipped while the good ones still apply. The diagnostic count (shown in a banner and printed by `config.reload`, where `0` means a clean reload) covers every ghostty config source, not just `ghostty.conf`, because the diagnostics do not record which file they came from. Check the Console log for the offending line.

A reload applies most keys to your open terminals right away — colors, theme, `cursor-style`, `macos-option-as-alt`, and the mouse and clipboard keys all take effect on the visible pane. Two kinds of key cannot change for a terminal that is already running, though:

- **Layout keys** — `window-padding-x`, `window-padding-y`, and other size-affecting keys — do not re-apply to an open pane. libghostty re-derives a surface's padding only when it is first laid out, so a reload (and even resizing the window) leaves existing panes on their old padding. Open a new session or new window to pick up the change; the panes that were already open need a relaunch.
- **Spawn-time keys** — `term` and `shell-integration-features` — are read once when the shell starts, so a reload cannot change them for a shell that is already running. Open a new session, whose shell is spawned fresh, to apply them.

## Copy/paste and shortcuts on a non-Latin or alternative layout

⌘C and ⌘V copy and paste on any keyboard layout, non-Latin ones (Russian, Greek, and so on) included, because agterm binds them to the physical key positions rather than to the character a layout prints. The physical C and V keys then work no matter what those keys produce in the active layout.

The reason is that ghostty's own copy/paste binds match the produced character: on a Russian layout the physical V key yields `м`, so the built-in `super+v` bind never fires. The bundled agterm defaults add physical-key binds (`super+key_c`, `super+key_v`) that match by position instead.

The same distinction lets you remap any shortcut for your layout:

- A physical key name (`key_c`, `key_v`, `key_a`, and so on) matches the key's position, whatever character it prints.
- A bare letter (`c`, `v`) matches the character the active layout produces at that key.

If you use a Latin alternative layout (Dvorak, Colemak, AZERTY) and want ⌘C/⌘V at your layout's own C and V letters instead of the QWERTY physical positions, override them in `~/.config/agterm/ghostty.conf` with character-based binds, and unbind the physical defaults so the QWERTY positions are freed:

```
keybind = super+key_c=unbind
keybind = super+key_v=unbind
keybind = super+c=copy_to_clipboard
keybind = super+v=paste_from_clipboard
```

Reload with **File ▸ Reload Config** or `agtermctl config reload`. The keybind syntax is at <https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind/reference>.

On Linux, agterm's own shortcuts — the `keymap.conf` built-ins and custom-command chords, the reserved Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+1/2, and the Ctrl+C attention-clear — are layout-independent: when the active layout produces no Latin character for a key, agterm re-translates the hardware key through the keyboard's Latin XKB group, so Ctrl+T fires under a Russian (or any other non-Latin) layout without remapping. Terminal typing is unaffected — non-Latin text reaches the shell unchanged — and a keyboard configured with no Latin group at all keeps the layout's own characters for matching. Two limits: a key whose non-Latin layout already prints a *different* Latin character than the Latin layout does (on Russian, Shift+2 prints `"`) still matches by the printed character, and a chord deliberately bound to a non-Latin letter (`map ctrl+ж`) cannot fire while a Latin group is configured, because matching uses the Latin re-translation.

## Other common issues

- **`agtermctl: command not found`.** Install it from Help ▸ Install Command Line Tool… (it symlinks into `/usr/local/bin`). You can also call it by its full path inside the app bundle: `agterm.app/Contents/MacOS/agtermctl`.
- **No desktop notifications.** macOS must have granted permission (System Settings ▸ Notifications ▸ agterm), and Settings ▸ General ▸ Notifications must be on. The unseen-count badge still tracks even when banners are off.
- **Agent-status glyph does not update.** Install the hooks from Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks…. For shell-integrated agents, start a fresh shell so the `source` line added to your shell rc takes effect. For Pi, restart it or run `/reload` so it loads `~/.pi/agent/extensions/agterm-status.ts`; Pi status is only installed when `~/.pi/agent` already exists. The hooks call `agtermctl session status`, so `agtermctl` must resolve first (see above).
- **Agent-status glyph updates the wrong session.** One session's glyph blinks while the work happens in another — typically when agents run inside tmux (or a tmux-backed session manager such as agent-deck). The working process inherited another session's `AGTERM_SESSION_ID`: the status hooks target whatever id is in their environment, and a long-lived daemon started from inside an agterm session (a tmux server is the usual carrier) captures that session's `AGTERM_*` variables into its global environment and passes them to every child it ever creates. Check `tmux show-environment -g | grep AGTERM` — if present, clear them with `tmux set-environment -g -r AGTERM_SESSION_ID` (and the other `AGTERM_*` names), then restart the affected panes. To avoid it, start such daemons with the variables scrubbed (`env -u AGTERM_SESSION_ID … <command>`) or from a terminal outside agterm.

## Claude Code's question or permission prompt stops responding after switching apps

While Claude Code shows an interactive prompt (a question menu or a permission dialog), switching to another app and back can leave that prompt unresponsive to the keyboard: the arrow keys and Return do nothing. The regular Claude Code prompt and the shell are unaffected, so you can still type there.

This is a Claude Code bug, not an agterm bug. When a window regains focus, agterm sends the standard terminal focus-in report (`ESC[I`, DEC private mode 1004), which any terminal does once an application turns focus reporting on. Claude Code's dialog input handler consumes that report instead of treating it as focus state, which wedges the prompt. It is tracked upstream as [anthropics/claude-code#72188](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/72188); the mouse-click variant is [#72273](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/72273).

agterm is behaving correctly: it emits paired focus-in and focus-out reports with nothing stray, and it follows the macOS focus-first convention, so a click that refocuses the window only focuses it and is not forwarded into the terminal. The trigger is the focus report itself, so any terminal with focus reporting on is affected the same way.

Workaround until the upstream fix: answer the prompt before switching away, or if you have already returned to a stuck prompt, press `Esc` to dismiss it and let Claude Code re-ask.

## Reporting a problem

Collect this before filing:

- agterm version (Agterm ▸ About Agterm).
- macOS version.
- The exact steps, what you expected, and what happened instead.
- A log excerpt from the `log show` command above, covering the moment you reproduced it.
- The relevant `keymap.conf` lines, if it is keymap-related.

Scrub anything private (tokens, internal hostnames, usernames embedded in paths) before sharing.

If you run a coding agent inside agterm (Claude Code or Codex with the agterm skill installed), it can help you write and file the report: it drafts an issue for a bug, or a Discussion for a feature request or question, shows it to you first, and never posts without your go-ahead.

Otherwise open one directly:
