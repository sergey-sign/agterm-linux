# GTK reports a rejected CSS declaration ONLY here, then carries on drawing without it -- so a typo in

# unit test and every AT-SPI assertion still passes. This is the only validity check on the app's CSS.
# Both severities count: GTK emits the `warning` variant from the same call site for a deprecated or
# unimplemented construct, which drops the declaration just as silently as an outright error.
# The `<data>` scope is what keeps this OUR CSS only. GTK's default parsing-error handler prints
# `Theme parser <severity>: <section>: <message>` for EVERY provider with no connected handler -- the
# Adwaita and libadwaita stylesheets included -- and a parse message from a system stylesheet is one the
# repo cannot fix, so matching it would red the build on someone else's CSS. The section name splits the
# two cleanly: all four of the app's providers load with gtk_css_provider_load_from_string, which passes
# a NULL GFile, and a section with no file prints the literal `<data>`; a resource/file-loaded stylesheet
# prints its display name instead. Verified against the real parser on GTK 4.22.4 and in the 4.14.0
